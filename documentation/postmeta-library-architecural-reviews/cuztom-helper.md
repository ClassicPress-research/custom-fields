# Design Patterns in Cuztom Helper

Cuztom Helper is a library which can be used in Themes and Plugins (It automaticly sees its path, so files will be included). It can also be placed in a custom folder, with the path set manually. It supports meta data for post types, users, terms. Forms are generated automatically. There is no form builder or something like that. Itâ€™s just a helper for developers.

All data is registered with an object with params: id, name, data. The data param is a big array with all the fields, tabs/accordions, grouped fields and their associated fields. The three object types (Meta_Box, User_Meta, Term_Meta) all extend from a class called Cuztom_Meta, which has a build method. This method converts all arrays to objects (recursive). The output method just checks some things (like, is there a description) and outputs the fields (with their own output method).

The fields are saved as separate post_meta.
